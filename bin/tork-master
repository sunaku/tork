TORK-MASTER 1 2012-01-25 16.0.0
==============================================================================

NAME
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tork-master - absorbs overhead and runs tests

SYNOPSIS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`tork-master` [*OPTION*]...

DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program reads the following single-line commands (JSON arrays) from its
standard input stream and performs the respective actions as described below.

`["load",` *paths*`,` *files*`]`
  Adds the given array of *paths* to Ruby's $LOAD_PATH, loads the given array
  of *files* after removing their ".rb" file extension if present, and prints
  the given command line to the standard output stream.

`["test",` *test_file*`,` *line_numbers*`]`
  Runs the given *test_file* in a forked child process while instructing your
  chosen unit testing framework (loaded by your test execution overhead) to
  only run those tests that are defined on the given array of *line_numbers*.

  Prints the given command line to the standard output stream immediately
  after forking the child process.

  Prints the given command line, modified with `"pass"` (if the test passed)
  or `"fail"` (if the test failed) in place of `"test"`, to the standard
  output stream after the forked child process finishes.

  The standard output and error streams of the forked child process are
  redirected to a file whose path and name are the same as that of the test
  file being run by the forked child process but with ".log" appended.

`["stop"]`
  Stops all tests that are currently running and prints the given command line
  to the standard output stream.

`["quit"]`
  Stops all tests that are currently running and exits.

ENVIRONMENT
