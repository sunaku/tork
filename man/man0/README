No configuration necessary: simply run \fB\fCtork\fR to start testing \fInow!\fP
.IP \(bu 2

.SS Architecture
.PP
Following UNIX philosophy, Tork is composed of simple text\-based programs that
\fIdo one thing well\fP\&.  As a result, you can even create your own user interface
for Tork by wrapping the 
.BR tork-driver (1) 
program appropriately!
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
.BR tork (1) 
is an interactive command\-line user interface for 
.BR tork-driver (1)
.IP \(bu 2
.BR tork-runner (1) 
runs your test suite once, non\-interactively, and then exits
.IP \(bu 2
.BR tork-herald (1) 
monitors current directory tree and reports changed files
.IP \(bu 2
.BR tork-driver (1) 
drives the engine according to the herald's observations
.IP \(bu 2
.BR tork-engine (1) 
tells master to run tests and keeps track of test results
.IP \(bu 2
.BR tork-master (1) 
absorbs test execution overhead and forks to run your tests
.IP \(bu 2
.BR tork-remote (1) 
remotely controls any Tork program running in the same \fB\fCpwd\fR
.IP \(bu 2
.BR tork-notify (1) 
notifies you when previously passing tests fail or vice versa
.RE
.PP
When the herald observes that files in or beneath the current directory have
been written to, it tells the driver, which then commands the master to fork a
worker process to run the tests affected by those changed files.  This is all
performed \fIautomatically\fP\&.  However, to run a test file \fImanually\fP, you can:
.nr step1 0 1
.RS
.IP \n+[step1]
Simply save the file!  When you do, Tork tries to figure out which tests
 inside your newly saved test file have changed (using diff and regexps)
 and then attempts to run just those.  To make it run \fIall\fP tests in your
 saved file, simply save the file \fIagain\fP without changing it.
.IP \n+[step1]
Type \fB\fCt\fR followed by a space and the file you want to run into

.SS With Bundler
.PP
The \fB\fCbundler\fR configuration helper loads a Bundler bundle into 
.BR tork-master (1).
The \fB\fCdefault\fR configuration helper does this for you automatically if there is
a \fB\fCGemfile\fR or \fB\fCGemfile.lock\fR file present in your current working directory.
.PP
As a result, you don't need to add Tork to your \fB\fCGemfile\fR \fIjust\fP to run tests!
Instead, installing Tork as a Ruby gem \fIoutside\fP of your bundle is sufficient.
.PP
Try it: go into any bundled application and call \fB\fCtork\fR to run its test suite.
.SS With MiniTest
.PP
MiniTest 1.3.2 and newer contain a bug where \fB\fCminitest/autorun\fR won't run any
tests if someone calls \fB\fCKernel#exit\fR explicitly or simply loads a library
(such as RSpec) which makes the call implicitly.  Use Tork 19.0.2+ to avoid
this problem or apply this patch to the minitest library
\[la]https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest/pull/183/files\[ra] to fix the problem.
.SS With RSpec
.PP
RSpec 2.9.0 and newer contain a bug where RSpec's autorun helper won't run any
specs if someone calls \fB\fCKernel#exit\fR explicitly or simply loads a library
(such as Test::Unit) which makes the call implicitly.  Use Tork 19.0.2+ to
avoid this problem or apply this patch to the rspec\-core library
\[la]https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/pull/720/files\[ra] to fix the problem.
.PP
RSpec 2.8.0 and older contain a bug
\[la]https://github.com/sunaku/tork/issues/31\[ra] where a nonzero exit status (caused
by an uncaught exception) is overridden by RSpec's \fB\fCKernel#at_exit\fR handler to
be zero, thereby falsely indicating that a spec had passed.  This patch
\[la]https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/pull/569/files\[ra] fixes the problem.
.SS With Ruby on Rails

For Rails 3 or newer, use the \fB\fCrails\fR configuration helper \fIbefore\fP the \fB\fCtest\fR

specified \fB\fCrails\fR configuration helper has a chance to disable class caching!

.SH Configuration
.PP
Tork looks for a configuration directory named \fB\fC\&.tork/\fR inside its working
directory.  The configuration directory contains specially\-named Ruby scripts,
within which you can query and modify the settings for various tork programs.
See the "FILES" sections in the manual pages of tork programs for details.
.PP
Note that tork \fIdoes not\fP automatically reload changes from your configuration
directory.  Consequently, you must restart tork if your configuration changes.
