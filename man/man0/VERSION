.SS Minor:

.IP \(bu 2
Add support for testing outside \fB\fCtest/\fR and \fB\fCspec/\fR directories.  This
change lets you run test files directly from the current working directory
without having to put them inside special \fB\fCtest/\fR and \fB\fCspec/\fR directories.
.PP
This can be useful if you are learning Ruby or writing tests for simple
scripts because you need not create a directory structure that is fit for
a larger application just for the sole purpose of running your tests!
.IP \(bu 2
Drop the \fB\fCdefault\fR configuration helper and load the \fB\fCconfig.rb\fR files of

tork/client: Replace write lock with queue to support SIGCHLD handler.
.PP
The SIGCHLD handler in 
.BR tork-master (1) 
can be triggered at any time, even
in the middle of writing to the standard output stream!  Locking access
to the output stream in normal code (outside the signal handler) would
freeze the program because the signal handler, waiting for the lock to
be released, would never return!
.PP
One solution is to maintain a thread\-safe queue of outgoing items that
need to be written to the output stream.  Both normal code and the
signal handler can quickly push an outgoing item onto the queue and
proceed with their business.  A separate thread can then have the sole
responsibility of (and access to) continually writing those outgoing
items to the output stream.

Fix SIGCHLD handling and test completion reporting (Daniel Pittman).
.PP
We need to reap all ready children in SIGCHLD, not just the first, and
should not be reporting completion in the signal handler.
.PP
On a fast machine, or where there is a slow hook executed at the
completion of a test run, more than one test child can terminate before
the SIGCHLD handler is invoked, or while it is running.
.PP
In that event we will only get another SIGCHLD when a new child
terminates, not to signal that there was more than one current
termination.  We need to loop to collect all terminated children during
each invocation of the handler.
.PP
Since we don't know which child terminated, we wait on any terminated
child with NOHANG, until it informs us that there are no more zombies
hanging about.
.PP
Doing all the work of finishing the test case, cleaning up, and running
user hooks inside the SIGCHLD handler block was pretty slow.  This could
lead to a big pile\-up of children that needed to be cleaned up, especially
if the user hook did something like run another external process to signal
completion.
.PP
Moving the heavy work of completion outside the signal handler makes the
whole thing a lot faster, and less likely to bump into the low limit for
per\-user processes on Mac OS\-X.
.IP \(bu 2
Send SIGTERM to each worker PGID to kill workers (Brian D. Burns).
.PP
Using Process.setsid() in the workers establishes each process "as a new

waiting for the workers to finish.

This reverts commit 0a0837f0b7ec92810e1c81d7506f2c8309f25f62 which was
originally written to skip the reporting of an empty test suite (master
does not load test files, workers do) by Test::Unit and Minitest in the
master process.
.PP
Such a harmless annoyance should not warrant the crippling of at_exit in
the master process because that would inhibit its valid uses as well:
