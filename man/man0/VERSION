This release adds a 
.BR tork-runner (1) 
program for non\-interactive test execution,
makes connections to tork subprocesses self\-healing, eliminates "address
already in use" errors, and fixes bugs in 
.BR tork-herald (1)

Add 
.BR tork-runner (1) 
to run tests once, non\-interactively, and then exit.
.PP
You can use 
.BR tork-runner (1) 
to run your test suite in one shot and then
exit with a nonzero status if tests failed, similar to \fB\fCrake test\fR\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Add Tork::Bridge to make connections to tork subprocesses self\-healing.
.PP
When a tork subprocess terminates, its parent process now replaces it
with a fresh instance.  Thus the tork process tree is now self\-healing.
.IP \(bu 2
Server: become a remote control to existing instance on socket fail.
.PP
If an another instance of this tork program is already running, then
become a remote to it rather than failing on binding its socket file.
.PP
This lets you run the same tork program more than once in the same working
directory; latter runs will become remote controls for the first instance!
.PP
This also lets you run an instance of 
.BR tork (1) 
for interactive usage and
then run 
.BR tork-runner (1) 
in another terminal in the same working directory
to re\-use the former's resources to run your test suite non\-interactively.

Socket files were always deleted: even if not ours.
.PP
If a tork instance was already running and a new tork instance was
started up in the same directory, then the latter would always delete
the common socket files (currently belonging to the former) upon exit.
.IP \(bu 2
Fail earlier on socket bind: avoid wasted overhead.
.PP
Before this patch, 
.BR tork-master (1) 
would first pay the price of absorbing
the test execution overhead before trying to bind its socket.  In case
of socket bind failure, the process would exit and the overhead wasted.

tork/client: Replace write lock with queue to support SIGCHLD handler.
.PP
The SIGCHLD handler in 
.BR tork-master (1) 
can be triggered at any time, even
in the middle of writing to the standard output stream!  Locking access
to the output stream in normal code (outside the signal handler) would
freeze the program because the signal handler, waiting for the lock to
be released, would never return!
.PP
One solution is to maintain a thread\-safe queue of outgoing items that
need to be written to the output stream.  Both normal code and the
signal handler can quickly push an outgoing item onto the queue and
proceed with their business.  A separate thread can then have the sole
responsibility of (and access to) continually writing those outgoing
items to the output stream.

Fix SIGCHLD handling and test completion reporting (Daniel Pittman).
.PP
We need to reap all ready children in SIGCHLD, not just the first, and
should not be reporting completion in the signal handler.
.PP
On a fast machine, or where there is a slow hook executed at the
completion of a test run, more than one test child can terminate before
the SIGCHLD handler is invoked, or while it is running.
.PP
In that event we will only get another SIGCHLD when a new child
terminates, not to signal that there was more than one current
termination.  We need to loop to collect all terminated children during
each invocation of the handler.
.PP
Since we don't know which child terminated, we wait on any terminated
child with NOHANG, until it informs us that there are no more zombies
hanging about.
.PP
Doing all the work of finishing the test case, cleaning up, and running
user hooks inside the SIGCHLD handler block was pretty slow.  This could
lead to a big pile\-up of children that needed to be cleaned up, especially
if the user hook did something like run another external process to signal
completion.
.PP
Moving the heavy work of completion outside the signal handler makes the
whole thing a lot faster, and less likely to bump into the low limit for
per\-user processes on Mac OS\-X.
.IP \(bu 2
Send SIGTERM to each worker PGID to kill workers (Brian D. Burns).
.PP
Using Process.setsid() in the workers establishes each process "as a new
session and process group leader".  So, the SIGTERM sent to the master's
process group was not recieved by the workers.  kill_workers was simply
waiting for the workers to finish.
.IP \(bu 2
Revert "skip at_exit() handlers defined in master process".
.PP
This reverts commit 0a0837f0b7ec92810e1c81d7506f2c8309f25f62 which was
originally written to skip the reporting of an empty test suite (master
does not load test files, workers do) by Test::Unit and Minitest in the
master process.
.PP
Such a harmless annoyance should not warrant the crippling of at_exit in
the master process because that would inhibit its valid uses as well:
