# _Test with fork_

Tork runs your tests as they change, in parallel:

  1. Absorbs test execution overhead into a master process.

  2. Forks to inherit overhead and run test files in parallel.

  3. Avoids running unchanged tests inside changed test files.

## Features

  * No configuration necessary: simply run `tork` to start testing *now!*

  * Runs test files in parallel using fork for multi-core/CPU utilization.

  * Tests *changes* your Ruby application for rapid TDD: avoids running (1)
    unchanged test files and (2) unchanged tests inside changed test files.

  * Supports MiniTest, Test::Unit, RSpec, and *any testing framework* that (1)
    exits with a nonzero status to indicate test failures and (2) is loaded by
    your application's `test/test_helper.rb` or `spec/spec_helper.rb` file.

  * Logs the output from your tests into separate files: one log per test.

  * Configurable through Ruby scripts in your current working directory.

  * You can override the modular `tork*` programs with your own in $PATH.

  * You can remotely control other `tork*` programs using tork-remote(1).

### Architecture

Following UNIX philosophy, Tork is composed of simple text-based programs that
*do one thing well*.  As a result, you can even create your own user interface
for Tork by wrapping the tork-driver(1) program appropriately!

* tork(1) is an interactive command-line user interface for tork-driver(1)
* tork-runner(1) runs your test suite once, non-interactively, and then exits
* tork-herald(1) monitors current directory tree and reports changed files
* tork-driver(1) drives the engine according to the herald's observations
* tork-engine(1) tells master to run tests and keeps track of test results
* tork-master(1) absorbs test execution overhead and forks to run your tests
* tork-remote(1) remotely controls any Tork program running in the same `pwd`
* tork-notify(1) notifies you when previously passing tests fail or vice versa

When the herald observes that files in or beneath the current directory have
been written to, it tells the driver, which then commands the master to fork a
worker process to run the tests affected by those changed files.  This is all
performed *automatically*.  However, to run a test file *manually*, you can:

  1. Simply save the file!  When you do, Tork tries to figure out which tests
     inside your newly saved test file have changed (using diff and regexps)
     and then attempts to run just those.  To make it run *all* tests in your
     saved file, simply save the file *again* without changing it.

  2. Type `t` followed by a space and the file you want to run into tork(1):

        # run all of test/some_test.rb
        t test/some_test.rb

        # run lines 4, 33, and 21 of test/some_test.rb
        t test/some_test.rb 4 33 21

  3. Send a `["run_test_file"]` message to tork-engine(1) using tork-remote(1):

        # run all of test/some_test.rb
        echo run_test_file test/some_test.rb | tork-remote tork-engine

        # run lines 4, 33, and 21 of test/some_test.rb
        echo run_test_file test/some_test.rb 4 33 21 | tork-remote tork-engine

Alternatively, you can use tork-runner(1) to run your test suite in one shot
and then exit with a nonzero status if tests failed, similar to `rake test`.

## Installation

    gem install tork

### Prerequisites

  * Ruby 1.8.7 or 1.9.3 or newer.

  * Operating system that supports POSIX signals and the `fork()` system call.
    To check if your system qualifies, launch irb(1) and enter the following:

        Process.respond_to? :fork  # must be true
        Signal.list.key? 'TERM'    # must be true
        Signal.list.key? 'KILL'    # must be true

  * To make the tork-herald(1) program's filesystem monitoring more efficient:

        gem install rb-inotify  # linux
        gem install rb-fsevent  # macosx

### Development

    git clone git://github.com/sunaku/tork
    cd tork
    bundle install
    bundle exec tork --help  # run it directly
    bundle exec rake --tasks # packaging tasks

## Usage

### At the command line

    tork --help

You can add line editing, history, and filename completion:

    rlwrap -c tork

You can control tork(1) interactively from another terminal:

    tork-remote tork-engine
    # type your commands here, one per line.
    # press Control-D to exit tork-remote(1)

You can also do the same non-interactively using a pipeline:

    # run lines 4, 33, and 21 of test/some_test.rb
    echo run_test_file test/some_test.rb 4 33 21 | tork-remote tork-engine

You can monitor your test processes from another terminal:

    watch 'pgrep -f ^tork | xargs -r ps uf'

### With Bundler

The `bundler` configuration helper loads a Bundler bundle into tork-master(1).
The `default` configuration helper does this for you automatically if there is
a `Gemfile` or `Gemfile.lock` file present in your current working directory.

As a result, you don't need to add Tork to your `Gemfile` _just_ to run tests!
Instead, installing Tork as a Ruby gem _outside_ of your bundle is sufficient.

Try it: go into any bundled application and call `tork` to run its test suite.

### With MiniTest

MiniTest 1.3.2 and newer contain a bug where `minitest/autorun` won't run any
tests if someone calls `Kernel#exit` explicitly or simply loads a library
(such as RSpec) which makes the call implicitly.  Use Tork 19.0.2+ to avoid
this problem or [apply this patch to the minitest library](
https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest/pull/183/files ) to fix the problem.

### With RSpec

RSpec 2.9.0 and newer contain a bug where RSpec's autorun helper won't run any
specs if someone calls `Kernel#exit` explicitly or simply loads a library
(such as Test::Unit) which makes the call implicitly.  Use Tork 19.0.2+ to
avoid this problem or [apply this patch to the rspec-core library](
https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/pull/720/files ) to fix the problem.

RSpec 2.8.0 and older contain [a bug](
https://github.com/sunaku/tork/issues/31 ) where a nonzero exit status (caused
by an uncaught exception) is overridden by RSpec's `Kernel#at_exit` handler to
be zero, thereby falsely indicating that a spec had passed.  [This patch](
https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/pull/569/files ) fixes the problem.

### With [Ruby on Rails]

For Rails 3 or newer, use the `rails` configuration helper *before* the `test`
or `spec` helpers.  Otherwise your test helper will load Rails *before* the
specified `rails` configuration helper has a chance to disable class caching!

For older Rails, make sure your `config/environments/test.rb` file contains:

    config.cache_classes = false

For older Rails, to use SQLite3 as your test database, install the [in-memory
database adapter][memory_test_fix].  Otherwise, you *might* face these errors:

> SQLite3::BusyException: database is locked

> cannot start a transaction within a transaction

For older Rails, to use SQLite3 as your test database along with browser-based
acceptance testing frameworks such as Capybara, see
http://www.spacevatican.org/2012/8/18/threading-the-rat/

## Configuration

Tork looks for a configuration directory named `.tork/` inside its working
directory.  The configuration directory contains specially-named Ruby scripts,
within which you can query and modify the settings for various tork programs.
See the "FILES" sections in the manual pages of tork programs for details.

Note that tork *does not* automatically reload changes from your configuration
directory.  Consequently, you must restart tork if your configuration changes.
