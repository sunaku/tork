.SH NAME
.PP
tork \- Continuous testing tool for Ruby
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fB\fCtork\fR [\fIOPTION\fP]... [\fICONFIG\fP]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program can be thought of as an interactive version of 
.BR tork-runner (1).

It functions as a rudimentary command\-line user interface to 
.BR tork-driver (1).
.PP
First, it applies the given \fICONFIG\fP values, which are either (1) paths to
directories that contain configuration files or (2) names of configuration
helpers listed in the description of the \fB\fCTORK_CONFIGS\fR environment variable.
.PP
Next, it waits for you to supply interactive commands either (1) directly on
its stdin or (2) remotely through 
.BR tork-remote (1).  
From then onward, type \fB\fCh\fR
and press ENTER to see a help message that shows a menu of accepted commands.
.PP
Some interactive commands accept additional arguments, described as follows.
.TP
\fB\fCt\fR \fItest_file\fP [\fIline_number\fP]...
Runs the given \fItest_file\fP while only running those tests that are defined
on the given list of \fIline_number\fPs.  If no \fIline_number\fPs are given, then
only those tests that have changed since the last run of the \fItest_file\fP
will now be run.
.TP
\fB\fCs\fR [\fIsignal\fP]
Stops test files that are currently running by sending the given \fIsignal\fP
(optional; defaults to \fB\fCSIGTERM\fR) to their respective worker processes.
.PP
This program can be controlled remotely by multiple 
.BR tork-remote (1) 
instances.
